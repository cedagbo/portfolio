## User Story

## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager's needs:
<ul>
    <li>
    When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatard, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
    </li>
    <li>
    When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
    </li>
    <li>
    When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
    </li>
    <li>
    When presented your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
    </li>
    <li>
    When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
    </li>
    <li>
    When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport
    </li>
</ul>
